# C Projects

Welcome to my C programming portfolio! 

## üß† About the C Language

The C programming language is a powerful, low-level language that provides direct access to memory. It‚Äôs widely used in embedded systems, operating systems, and system-level programming due to its efficiency and control over hardware.

Key strengths of C:
- Precise control of memory with pointers
- Efficient compilation and execution
- Portability and versatility
- Foundation for learning other languages like C++, Rust, and even Python internals
